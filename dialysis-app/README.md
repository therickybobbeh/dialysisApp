## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy

### **Atomic Design Theory**
This project follows **Atomic Design Theory**, ensuring a **scalable, modular, and maintainable UI**. The UI components are structured into five layers:

1. **Atoms** â€“ Smallest elements like buttons, inputs, labels.
2. **Molecules** â€“ Combinations of atoms, such as form groups.
3. **Organisms** â€“ Complex UI sections made up of molecules, such as modals or cards.
4. **Templates** â€“ Layout structures that define the skeleton of a page.
5. **Pages** â€“ Fully assembled UI pages using templates and organisms.

This methodology ensures **reusability**, **scalability**, and **maintainability** of UI components.

Within this we also have the following directories:
1. **Compoenets** - this will be where we store reusable components
2. **Models** - represents how data should be structured
3. **Pages** - This will be our main pages that will be rendered
4. **Services** - This will be where we store our services that will be used to fetch data from the backend and state management

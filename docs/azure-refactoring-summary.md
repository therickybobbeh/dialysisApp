# Azure Deployment Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to the Peritoneal Dialysis Application to optimize it for Azure deployment.

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Container Optimization

- **Backend Dockerfile**:
  - Implemented multi-stage build for smaller container images
  - Optimized dependencies installation with proper caching
  - Added health check endpoint for container monitoring
  - Configured non-root user for improved security
  - Added robust error handling and logging

- **Frontend Dockerfile**:
  - Implemented multi-stage build for Angular application
  - Optimized node_modules caching
  - Added health check endpoint in nginx configuration
  - Configured proper caching and compression settings

### 2. Azure PostgreSQL Integration

- Updated database connection configuration to support Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- Implemented connection pooling with optimized settings
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for connection resilience
- Prepared for Managed Identity authentication (when deployed in Azure)
- Enhanced the entrypoint script to handle Azure PostgreSQL specific requirements

### 3. Application Monitoring

- Integrated Azure Application Insights for comprehensive monitoring
- Implemented structured logging for better analysis
- Added request tracking middleware with correlation IDs
- Created health check endpoints for both backend and frontend services

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline

- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated CI/CD to Azure
- Configured proper build, test, and deployment stages
- Added environment-based deployment options (dev/prod)
- Implemented proper secret management using GitHub secrets

### 5. Infrastructure as Code

- Created Bicep files for declarative infrastructure definition
- Implemented best practices for Azure resource provisioning
- Provided deployment script for manual infrastructure deployment
- Ensured consistent environment configuration

## Deployment Options

You now have two options for deploying the application to Azure:

### Option 1: GitHub Actions Pipeline (Recommended)

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build, test, and deploy your application when you push to the main branch or manually trigger the workflow.

**Setup Requirements**:
1. Configure GitHub Secrets as described in the `azure-deployment.md` document
2. Push your code to the main branch or manually trigger the workflow

### Option 2: Manual Infrastructure Deployment

The Bicep files and deployment script allow you to manually deploy the infrastructure.

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Run `./infra/deploy.sh [environment]` to deploy the infrastructure
2. Build and push your container images to the created Azure Container Registry
3. Update container apps to use the new images

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Secrets**: Set up the required GitHub secrets for CI/CD pipeline
2. **Test Deployment**: Run an initial deployment to verify the setup
3. **Monitor Application**: Use Azure Application Insights to monitor application performance
4. **Optimize Resources**: Review resource usage and adjust scaling parameters as needed
5. **Implement Advanced Features**: Consider adding Key Vault integration, Azure Front Door, or other Azure services based on your needs
